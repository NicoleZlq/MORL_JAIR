# MORL/TD
## Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning with Tchebycheff Decomposition

The experiments on three domains, Deep Sea Treasure (DST), minecart, and Mo-Hopper.

The code for our MORL/TD algorithm is represented by the `use_td` module in `MorlDevelopment\morl_baselines\multi_policy\td\td.py` 

When testing the DST environment, the settings for the `morl/td` method and the related `gpi/pd` and `gpi/ls` are explained in the comments within the `MorlDevelopment\MORLTD_DST.py` file. Similarly, `MORLTD_hopper` and `MORLTD_mincart` provide the parameter settings for different algorithms.
